    <h2>Where I live</h2> 
        <p class="living">I have been living with my dad in Alexandria, VA since 2018. He feeds me, bathes me, and gives me belly rubs which I love.</p>
    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
      <img src="../Images/Boss.jpg" class="pose" alt="Boss posing for a photo">
        <p>I am an 8 year old English Bulldog who weighs 54 pounds. I like to bark at other animals and when I'm not doing that I like to eat yummy food and sleep a lot.</p>
        <p>I don't get along with other doggies so don't bring them near me please! You can send me yummy treats to my house anytime, thanks!</p>
